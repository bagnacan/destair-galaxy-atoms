    content: 'In this tour, we will carry out transcript quantification, and differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data.<br />
Here, we will leverage on two tools: <b>HTSeq-Count</b>, to count the number of sequence reads overlapping with predetermined genomic features (e.g. exons, genes, promoter regions), and <b>DESeq2</b>, to assess the level of gene expression.<br /><br />

    content: 'Look for the <b>HTSeq-Count</b> tool.<br />
HTSeq-Count calculates the number of reads that have been mapped against the genomic feature of a reference genome. Here, a feature is a positional range on a chromosome, or a union of such ranges, representing exons, genes, promoter regions, etc.<br /><br />
