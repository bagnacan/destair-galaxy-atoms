    content: 'In this tour, we will align sequence reads against a reference genome. This represents a necessary task for the quantification and estimation of gene expression, because it provides a mapping between the processed reads and a reference genome, which can be later used in conjunction with statistical methods to evaluate transcript abundance.<br />
Here, we will leverage on <b>STAR</b>, an ultrafast and low error rate RNA-Seq aligner.<br /><br />

    content: 'Look for the <b>STAR</b> tool.<br />
STAR is an ultrafast and sensitive RNA-Seq aligner, that maps sequence reads against a reference genome.<br />
Here, we want to align the sequence reads from the control and treated samples, against the provided reference genome.<br /><br />
