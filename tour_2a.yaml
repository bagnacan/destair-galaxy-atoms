    content: 'In this tour, we will align sequence reads against a reference genome. This represents a necessary task for the quantification and estimation of gene expression, because it provides a mapping between the processed reads and a reference genome, which can be later used in conjunction with statistical methods to evaluate transcript abundance.<br />
Here, we will leverage on <b>HISAT2</b>, an efficient RNA-Seq aligner.<br /><br />
