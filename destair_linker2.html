This type of visualization is designed for tabular seperated results table of RNA-Seq datasets tested for differentially expressed genes using DESeq2.
</p>
<p>
During <img src="./logo_destair.png" height="15" /> workflow generation,
an artificialy created results table from control vs. treatment samples will be used to create a heatmap. The values are based on the base-mean readcount over all samples according to the predicted log2 fold-change.
