This represents the first task in analysing raw high throughput sequences,<br />
because it provides an overview of the overall quality of data, as well as<br />
a mean to remove low quality sequence reads that might ultimately bias the<br />
interpretation of results.<br />
Here, we will leverage on two tools: <b>FastQC</b>, to assess the quality<br />
of the provided sequences, and <b>Cutadapt</b>, to remove low quality<br />
reads.<br /><br />

The <b>Per base sequence quality</b> plot shows the average quality<br />
scores of all reads of each sequence of the provided input dataset.<br />
The Y axis shows the quality score: the higher, the better the base<br />
call. The background color of the graph divides the base call<br />
operation into:<br />
- Very good quality (green)<br />
- Reasonable quality (orange)<br />
- Poor quality (red).<br />
The quality of each call usually degrades as the sequencing run<br />
progresses. Here however, each provided input dataset shows lower<br />
average quality scores at the beginning of each sequence. Although<br />
these scores still account for reasonable quality reads, a reason<br />
behind this trend might be that the image scanner focus had to be<br />
recalibrated during the first sequence run cycles.<br />

The <b>Per sequence quality scores</b> plot shows if a subset of<br />
sequences have universally low quality values.<br />
If a significant subset of sequences in a run have overall low quality<br />
scores, this suggests that some kind of systematic problem occurred<br />
during the sequencing experiment. Here, the entire sequence set scores<br />
well, showing the desired overall behavior for a sequence set: a peak<br />
(large sequence subset) showing a good score, and a short tail<br />
(sequence subset) scoring lower, although still well.<br />

If a sequencer is unable to make a base call with confidence, then it<br />
will place an N, where N represents an ambiguous nucleotide: a base<br />

High number of Ns are a sign of low quality sequence reads, which might<br />
be due to transient problems occurring during the sequencing experiment.<br />
