    content: 'In this tour, we will align sequence reads against a reference genome. This represents a necessary task for the quantification and estimation of gene expression, because it provides a mapping between the processed reads and a reference genome, which can be later used in conjunction with statistical methods to evaluate transcript abundance.<br />
Here, we will leverage on <b>HISAT2</b>, an efficient RNA-Seq aligner.<br /><br />

HISAT2 is an efficient aligner for mapping sequence reads against a reference genome.<br />
Here, we want to align the sequence reads from the control and treated samples, against the provided reference genome.<br /><br />

    content: 'In section <b>Source for the reference genome</b>, select <b>Use a genome from history</b>, and specify the uploaded reference genome.<br />
If the reference genome does not appear in the box, then you need to first convert it to the correct format. In this case:<br />
- Click on the pencil icon of the reference genome entry in your history<br />
- Select the <b>Datatype</b> tab<br />
- Select <b>FASTA</b><br />
- Click <b>Save</b>.<br />
When you are done converting, reload HISAT2, and the reference genome.<br /><br />
