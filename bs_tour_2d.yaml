The background color of the graph divides the base call operation into:<br />
- Very good quality (green)<br />
- Reasonable quality (orange)<br />
- Poor quality (red).<br />
The quality of each call usually degrades as the sequencing run progresses. Here however, each provided input dataset shows lower average quality scores at the beginning of each sequence. Although these scores still account for reasonable quality reads, a reason behind this trend might be that the image scanner focus had to be recalibrated during the first sequence run cycles.<br /> More information on the <b>Per base sequence quality</b> plot can be found <a href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/3%20Analysis%20Modules/2%20Per%20Base%20Sequence%20Quality.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />'
