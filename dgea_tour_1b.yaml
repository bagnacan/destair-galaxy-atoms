This represents the first task in analysing raw high throughput sequence reads, because it provides an overview of the overall quality of data, as well as a mean to remove low quality sequence reads that might ultimately bias the interpretation of results.<br />
Here, we will leverage on two tools: <b>FastQC</b>, to assess the quality of the provided sequences, and <b>Trimmomatic</b>, to remove low sequence quality reads.<br /><br />

    content: 'Under <b>Summary</b>, click on <b>Per base sequence quality</b>.<br /><br />The <b>Per base sequence quality</b> plot shows the average quality scores of all reads of each sequence of the provided input dataset.<br />
The Y axis shows the quality score: the higher, the better the base call. The background color of the graph divides the base call operation into:<br />
- Very good quality (green)<br />
- Reasonable quality (orange)<br />
- Poor quality (red).<br />
The quality of each call usually degrades as the sequencing run progresses. Here however, each provided input dataset shows lower average quality scores at the beginning of each sequence. Although these scores still account for reasonable quality reads, a reason behind this trend might be that the image scanner focus had to be recalibrated during the first sequence run cycles.<br />

If a significant subset of sequences in a run have overall low quality scores, this suggests that some kind of systematic problem occured during the sequencing experiment. Here, the entire sequence set scores well, showing the desired overall behavior for a sequence set: a peak (large sequence subset) showing a good score, and a short tail (sequence subset) scoring lower, although still well.<br />

The four bases should not be hugely imbalanced. However, some libraries will always produce biased sequence composition when fragmentation does not occur randomly. Here, each provided input dataset shows the desired trend.<br />

This should follow a normal distribution. However, unusually shaped distribution might occur in case of a contaminated library. A shifted normal distribution instead indicates some systematic bias, independent of base position. Here, each provided sample aligns to the theoretical (blue line) CG distribution.<br />

    content: 'Under <b>Summary</b>, click on <b>Per base N content</b>.<br /><br />The <b>Per base N content</b> plot shows the percentage of N occurrences in the sequence reads.<br />
If a sequencer is unable to make a base call with confidence, then it will place an N, where N represents an ambiguous nucleotide: a base which could not be correctly identified.<br />
High number of Ns are a sign of low quality sequence reads, which might be due to transient problems occurring during the sequencing experiment. Here, each provided sample shows the ideal percentage of N at each position in the sequence set, accounting for a good sequencing run.<br />

If a sequence is overrepresented, this means that it is either highly biologically significant, or that it is contaminant for the current library. Here, each provided sequence dataset shows no overrepresented sequences.<br />
