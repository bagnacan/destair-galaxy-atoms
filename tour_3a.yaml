    content: 'DESeq2 can handle multiple <i>factor</i>s affecting your experiment, each of which has two <i>levels</i> (or <i>states</i>). For instance, we can describe our experiment in terms of its treatment factor, which is conditioned by two different healthy states: control, and treated. Thus, we will describe our experiment accordingly.<br /><br />
In section <b>Specify a factor name</b>, change the default name with <b>Treatment</b>.<br />
In its two subsections <b>Specify a factor level</b>, change the first default value to <b>Control</b>, and the second to <b>Treated</b>. Then, click on the <b>Multiple datasets</b> icon of each factor level, and select all control and treated samples respectively.<br /><br />
