    content: 'In this tour, we will carry out transcript quantification, and differential gene expression analysis using RNA-Seq data.<br />
Here, we will leverage on two tools: <b>featureCounts</b>, to count the number of sequence reads overlapping with predetermined genomic features (e.g. exons, genes, promoter regions), and <b>DESeq2</b>, to assess the level of gene expression.<br /><br />

featureCounts calculates the number of reads that have been mapped against the genomic feature of a reference genome. Here, a feature is a positional range on a chromosome, or a union of such ranges, representing exons, genes, promoter regions, etc.<br /><br />

For instance, we can describe our experiment in terms of its treatment factor, which is conditioned by two different healthy states: control, and treated. Thus, we will describe our experiment accordingly.<br />
In section <b>Specify a factor name</b>, change the default name with <b>Treatment</b>.<br />
In its two subsections <b>Specify a factor level</b>, change the first default value to <b>Control</b>, and the second to <b>Treated</b>. Then, click on the <b>Multiple datasets</b> icon of each factor level, and select all control and treated samples respectively.<br /><br />
