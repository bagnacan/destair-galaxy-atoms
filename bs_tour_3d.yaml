    content: 'In this tour we will align MethylC sequenced reads against a
reference<br />
genome. This represents a necessary task for the quantification of<br />
methilated Cytosines in CpG and CHG genomic contexts which can be later<br />
used to infer and evaluate e.g. enhancer promoter or gene body<br />
methilation rates.<br />
Here, we will leverage on <b>Segemehl</b>.<br /><br />

Segemehl is an efficient aligner for mapping sequence reads against a reference
genome.<br />
Here we want to align the sequences from the imported samples against<br />
the provided reference genome.<br /><br />
