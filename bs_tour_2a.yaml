    content: 'In this tour, we will align MethylC sequenced reads against a reference genome. This represents a necessary task for the quantification of methilated Cytosines in CpG and CHG genomic contexts which can be later used to infer and evaluate e.g. enhancer promoter or gene body methilation rates.<br />
Here, we will leverage on <b>Bismark</b>.<br /><br />
