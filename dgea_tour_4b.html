      <h4>Description:</h4>
      <p style="border:2px; border-radius: 5px; border-style:solid; border-color:#ED1D99; padding: 1em;">
        <b>HTSeq-count</b> is very similar to its alternative featureCounts: both require the provided input alignment
        files to be in BAM or SAM format, as well as a genome feature file in GTF or GFF format. Although these tools
        return similar results, counts can vary considerably in case of paired-ended data. FeatureCounts is faster than
        its counterpart HTSeq-count, and its count table takes into account feature overlaps. On the contrary,
        HTSeq-count is slower and more consirvative in terms of counting fragments whose alignment overlaps multiple features.
        Compared to featureCounts, HTSeq-count is older, and therefore widely used in the community.
        <br /><br />
        <b>DESeq2</b> is a tool to carry out differential gene expression analysis. This tool computes ranking and visualization of count data for hypothesis testing under multiple sampling conditions.
